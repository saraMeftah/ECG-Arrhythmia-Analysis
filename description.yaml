## Sampling Frequency (360 Hz)

The ECG signals are sampled at **360 Hz**, meaning:

- 360 samples per second
- Each sample ≈ 2.78 ms
- A heartbeat spans **many samples**, not just one point

This resolution allows accurate analysis of ECG waveforms
(P wave, QRS complex, T wave).

## Heartbeat Segmentation (Why ±100 samples?)

Each heartbeat is centered on an **R-peak** provided in the annotation file.

We extract:
- 100 samples before the R-peak
- 100 samples after the R-peak

Total samples per beat:

This window captures the **full heartbeat waveform**.

##  Feature Extraction

For each heartbeat (MLII lead), the following features are extracted:

- **Mean**: average signal level (baseline)
- **Standard Deviation (std)**: signal variability
- **Max**: R-peak amplitude
- **Min**: lowest voltage (Q/S wave depth)

These features form the input for machine learning models.

##  RR Intervals

RR interval = time between two consecutive R-peaks.

Computed as:

RR intervals are important for detecting rhythm irregularities.

##  Labels

- `0` → Normal heartbeat (`N`)
- `1` → Arrhythmia (any non-`N` annotation)

 ️ In the current single-patient experiment, arrhythmic beats are much fewer than normal beats, resulting in class imbalance.
